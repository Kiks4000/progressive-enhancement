        <p><div class="first">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said :</div> <q class="quote villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> The farmer said, <q class="quote farmer">“Maybe.”</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said : <q class="quote villagers"> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again said : <q class="quote farmer">“Maybe.”</q> 
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said : <q class="quote villagers"> “Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong></q> and the farmer responded : <q class="quote farmer"> “Maybe.”</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said : <q class="quote villagers"> “Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said : <q class="quote farmer"> “Maybe.”</q>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <stron class="good">good</stron> fortune.
